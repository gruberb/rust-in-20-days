# Learn Rust in 20 days

So you want to learn Rust. There are a few topics you have to adjust to if coming from a scripting language, and a few you probably won't encounter in the near term.

This guide is very practical and pragmatic. It focusses on the things you *need* to know when first starting out with Rust. Once you feel more comfortable, you can take on extended topics as needed.
